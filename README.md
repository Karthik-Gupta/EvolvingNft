# Evolving NFT demonstration project

This is a sample project to demonstrate the idea of evolving NFT in its basic form.

The basic idea is:
There can be a base character, different accessories for it and the combination of them will be the new NFT being evolved.

Implementation:
Character sc - ERC 721 <br />
Accessory sc - ERC 1155 <br />
Evolved sc - ERC 721 <br />

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
