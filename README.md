# Evolving NFT demonstration project

This is a sample project to demonstrate the idea of evolving NFT in its basic form.

The basic idea is:
There can be a base character, different accessories for it and the combination of them will be the new NFT being evolved.

Implementation:
Base character sc - ERC 721
Accessory sc - ERC 1155
Evolved sc - ERC 721

Try running some of the following tasks:

npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
